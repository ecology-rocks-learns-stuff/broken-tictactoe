# Tic Tac Toe (nonfunctional archived project)

This is a project that I started for FreeCodeCamp, but never quite finished the functionality. Since I'm developing a more comprehensive GitHub Archive of my projects, I'm sharing it here. Since I'm working on a Chromebook, there's need to use glitch.com to create the code files. 

You can find this code working in two places:
  * https://equable-cannon.glitch.me/
  * https://codepen.io/ecology-rocks/pen/vNWXPN
